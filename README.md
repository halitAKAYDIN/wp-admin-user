### Few days ago, we ran into an issue where a user’s site got hacked and their admin account was deleted from the database. This locked them out of their site without any other entry. We went in to the phpMyAdmin and created a new admin user to grant them access. 

#### Remember to change the databasename to the database you are working with. Also don’t forget to change the appropriate values.
